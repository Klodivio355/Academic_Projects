## Adaptive Intelligence

This module assignment consisted in 2 tasks:
- Assignment 1 : Multi-class classification on the famous MNIST dataset using Multi-layer Perceptrons. The whole implementation is in Python, primarly using Numpy. The system includes the implementation of different layer dimensions, regularisation etc..
- Assignment 2 : Multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning were applied to an autonomous navigation system. An implementation of SARSA has been carried out as well an Eligibity-Trace feature. Again, this implementation is relatively low-level as it is in Numpy.
