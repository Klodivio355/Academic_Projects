## Adaptive Intelligence

This module assignment consisted in 2 tasks:
- Assignment 1 : Multi-class classification on the famous MNIST dataset using Multi-layer Perceptrons. The whole implementation is in Python, primarly using Numpy. The system includes the implementation of different layer dimensions, regularisation etc..
- Assignment 2 : Multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning were applied to an autonomous navigation system. An implementation of SARSA has been carried out as well an Eligibity-Trace feature. Again, this implementation is relatively low-level as it is in Numpy.


## Mutimodal Pneumonia Etiology Classification

Using the large and complex medical dataset MIMIC-IV along with the linked X-ray dataset MIMIC-CXR. We provide a complete, research oriented framework that allows for a multimodal classification (using both X-rays as images and Static Data) of pneumonia 2 most common causes (i.e. etiologies) being Viral and Bacterial. Such difference is depicted below :

This study made it to a paper that was submitted to the [LMedical Image Understanding and Analysis 2022](https://www.miua2022.com) conference by The University of Cambridge. The paper is currently under review and is available along with the project's description in the repository.
